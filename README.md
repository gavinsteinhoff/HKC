# HKC

HKC is a bot that mostly does moderation, but may become a more generic bot as development goes on.

[Invite Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=883209997587202049&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) (Permissions will be reworked so admin right will not have to be granted.)

## Setup

The bot must be setup first. The commmand, `/guild update` contains all the info that can be updated.

The moderation will need the log channel setup to work.

## Moderation

Users can also be banned from submiting feedback, `/feedback ban`
